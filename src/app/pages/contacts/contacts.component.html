      CU/ONE brings together two symbolic origins: CU stands for copper – the first metal shaped by human hands,
      symbolizing craftsmanship,
      creative foundations, and reflecting the Latin origin of the name Kipras.
      This also inspired the copper-toned orange used in the identity.
      ONE represents the first spark of creation. Together, they express the studio’s link to ancient craft, personal
      roots, and new creative beginnings.
